After completing this section, students should understand relations and functions as mathematical tools.

We run our daily lives by our understanding the connections between things.  There is no better example of this than the grocery store.  While shopping, we understand that there is a connection between products and prices. We often use this product-price relation to make shopping decisions.  Let's investigate this product-price relation.

Just like with NFL quarterbacks, this is a big relation with lots of pairs, too many pairs.  We'll simplify a bit to make it more manageable. 

\begin{itemize}
\item We'll focus on a single store : Bob's Groceries
\item We'll focus on a single day : Aug 12, 2015
\end{itemize}


\begin{definition}
\textbf{The Product-Price Relation}
\begin{itemize}
\item The domain of the Product-Price Relation is the collection of all products in Bob's Groceries on Aug 12, 2015. 
\item The codomain of the Product-Price Relation is the collection of all prices. 
\item A (product, price) pair is in the Product-Price Relation if this product had this price in Bob's Groceries on Aug 12, 2015. Otherwise, it is not in the Product-Price Relation.
\end{itemize}
\end{definition}


\quad \\



\begin{example}
\begin{itemize}
\item (Freshair Wheat Bread, \$1.19) $\in$ Product-Price\item (Greenforest Yellow Corn, \$0.89) $\in$ Product-Price\item (Greenforest Yellow Corn, \$0.79) $\in$ Product-Price
 \end{itemize}
 \end{example}


\quad \\




\textbf{More Simplifying} 
It is possible that there is more than one size of Greenforest Yellow Corn, which could add some confusion.  Instead of writing a description of the product, let?s use the global trade identification number, i.e. its bar code number.


\begin{definition}
\textbf{The Product-Price Relation (improved)}
\begin{itemize}
\item The domain of the Product-Price Relation is the collection of all product GTIN numbers used in Bob's Groceries on Aug 12, 2015. \item The codomain of the Product-Price Relation is the collection of all prices. \item A (number, price) pair is in the Product-Price Relation if this is a GTIN number for a product in Bob's Groceries and this product had this price in Bob's Groceries on Aug 12, 2015. Otherwise, it is not in the Product-Price Relation.
\end{itemize}
\end{definition}



\begin{example}
\begin{itemize}
\item (145526374467, \$1.19) $\in$ Product-Price\item (176228354233, \$0.89) $\in$ Product-Price\item (176228354233, \$0.79) $\in$ Product-Price
 \end{itemize}
 \end{example}

\textbf{Product-Price}To the right are all of the pairs inside the Product-Price relation.  Bob's Grocery is not a very big store. (It scrolls.)A list is one mathematical tool for describing the connections in this relation.

\end{image}The map lists the domain items and the codomain items and then identifies pairs in the relation with a line segment.



GTIN numbers are twelve digit numbers, but not every twelve digit number is a GTIN number. That means not every twelve digit number is in the domain the Product-Price relation.
It could also happen that the twelve digit number is a GTIN number, but Bob?s Groceries might not carry that product.  Again the number would not be in the domain.This will be a common theme with our functions. By describing the domain as GTIN numbers we know that we are dealing with 12-digit numbers, but not all 12-digit numbers. Our description is implying which 12-digit numbers are in the domain.  We say that the domain is implied.

\begin{definition}An implied domain is one that is not stated explicitly. It is inferred from the description of the relation.
