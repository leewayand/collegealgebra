\begin{document}

\begin{definition}
  The map below defines the \textbf{Cones} relation. 
  
  

    \includegraphics[width=293px,height=214px]{pics/r20.png}

  
 

  The \dfn{Cones} relation includes three sets:
    \begin{itemize}
    \item The domain consists of 3 family members identified in the map.
    \item The codomain consists of the 4 ice cream cones identified in the map.
    \item A set of ordered pairs. The pair (person, cone) is a member of the Cones relation if the person is connected to the cone with an arrow.
    \end{itemize}

  
  
\end{definition}







\begin{exercise}

Are any two domain family members partnered with the same cone in the codomain?

  \begin{multipleChoice}
    \choice{Yes}
    \choice[correct]{No}
  \end{multipleChoice}
  \begin{feedback}
Each family member is connected to a unique cone.
  \end{feedback}
\end{exercise}






\begin{exercise}
Is Cones a well-defined function?
  \begin{multipleChoice}
    \choice[correct]{Yes}
    \choice{No}
  \end{multipleChoice}
  \begin{feedback}
Each domain person is associated with exactly one codomain cone.
  \end{feedback}
\end{exercise}







\begin{exercise}
How many items are in the range of Cones? $\answer{3}$
  \begin{feedback}
Only three of the four cones have an arrow pointing to them.
  \end{feedback}
\end{exercise}







\begin{exercise}
 Solve Cones(person) = {\includegraphics[width=15px,height=35px]{pics/elements/cones/cones4.png}}
  \begin{multipleChoice}
    \choice{{\includegraphics[width=33px,height=49px]{pics/elements/family/family2.png}}}
    \choice{{\includegraphics[width=34px,height=55px]{pics/elements/family/family4.png}}}
    \choice{{\includegraphics[width=33px,height=60px]{pics/elements/family/family5.png}}}
    \choice[correct]{No Solution}
  \end{multipleChoice}
  \begin{feedback}
There is no arrow pointing to {\includegraphics[width=15px,height=35px]{pics/elements/cones/cones4.png}}.
  \end{feedback}
\end{exercise}
