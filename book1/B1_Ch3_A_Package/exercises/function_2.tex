    \includegraphics[width=292px,height=213px]{pics/r4.png}

  
 

  The \dfn{Wardrobe} relation includes three sets:
    \begin{itemize}
    \item The domain consists of 7 shirts identified in the map.
    \item The codomain consists of the 5 family members identified in the map.
    \item A set of ordered pairs. The pair (shirt, person) is a member of the Wardrobe relation if the shirt is connected to the family member with an arrow.
    \end{itemize}
