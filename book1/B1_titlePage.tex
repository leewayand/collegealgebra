Book 1 introduces relations and functions. Relations are organizational tools.  We use relations to organize our thoughts on connections between two sets. Functions are special types of relations.  They are relations with an additional rule, which clears up a very messy picture for us. 

The main ideas from Book1 are

\begin{itemize}
\item Domain 
\item Codomain
\item Pairs
\item Range
\item Function Notation
\end{itemize}
