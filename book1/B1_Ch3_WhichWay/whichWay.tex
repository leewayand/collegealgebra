Given two sets and connections between their members, we always have a relation. But, we don't always have a function. The extra rule can be a kink at times. 


\begin{example}
Here is a diagram of two sets and line segments illustrating the connections.

\begin{center}
\includegraphics{pics/func.png}
\end{center}
\quad \\


We naturally read left to right, so it is common to see \includegraphics{pics/circle.png} as the domain and \includegraphics{pics/triangle.png} as the range.  The pairs would be 
\[\{ (A, 3), (B, 3), (C, 4) \}
\]

But, we could just as easily see \includegraphics{pics/triangle.png} as the domain and \includegraphics{pics/circle.png} as the range.  Then the pairs would be
\[\{ (3, A), (3, B), (4, C) \}
\]

Either one is ok. Both are relations. \\However, they are not both functions. \\
\quad \\The pairs $\{ (A, 3), (B, 3), (C, 4) \}$ follow the rule for a function. \\We would think that \includegraphics{pics/triangle.png} is a \textbf{function} of \includegraphics{pics/circle.png}. The function value in \includegraphics{pics/triangle.png} depends on the value in \includegraphics{pics/circle.png}. \\


The pairs $\{ (3, A), (3, B), (4, C) \}$ do not follow the rule for a function.  \\3 is in the domain and it is in two different pairs. We would think that \includegraphics{pics/circle.png} is not a function of \includegraphics{pics/triangle.png}.

\end{example}

For a function, not only is the connection between the sets important, but it is just as important to designate which set is the domain and which is the range. \\Which way does the function go?

\begin{example}

\begin{itemize}
\item Ice cream flavors is a function of kindergarteners. \\Kindergarteners is the domain and each kindergartener is paired with exactly one ice cream flavor.\item IKindergarteners is not a function of ice cream flavors. \\Chocolate would be in the domain and paired with six kindergarteners.\item IGrocery store prices is a function of products.\\Each item in the store is paired with exactly one price.\item IGrocery store products is not a function of prices.\\\$1.24 would be a price in the domain that is paired with multiple products.\item IState flags is a function of states.\\Each state in the domain is paired with exactly one flag.\item IStates is also a function of State flags.\\Each state flag in the domain is paired with exactly one state.
\end{itemize}

\end{example}
