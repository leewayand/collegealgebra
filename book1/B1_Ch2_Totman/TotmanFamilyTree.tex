When we think of our family tree we are engaging in science. That is, we are searching for and identifying structure. We identify patterns and connections.  We establish reasons for details. We hypothesize on the evolution of the tree.  Upon discovering the structure of our family tree, we then use mathematics to describe our findings to other people. And as is often the case, the mathematics with which we choose to communicate our discoveries suggests further patterns and connections, which leads to more science. We travel this math-science circle every day.

The Totman family tree has structure. Diagram 2.1 is our mathematics describing the structure. As we have heard, this structure can be quite complex, so let's keep it simple to begin with.

There are two main connections people experience within their family tree: "related to" and "a relative of". Even within "related", we can differentiate between "related by blood" and "related through marriage". Let's leave marriage out of the discussion and focus on just related by blood.  How does the mathematics of our tree diagram show this?



\begin{notation}
\quad \\

The mathematics describing the Totman family tree places dashed line segments under spouses, indicating marriage, and solid line segments connect people related by blood. There are a lot of dashed and solid line segments in the Totman diagram!  \\

How do we decipher this mathematical description?

In our simplified story, a blood relation stops at a marriage.  Blood does not cross completely over a full dashed line segment. That takes you to a branch of relatives perhaps, but the blood line is broken.  Half a dashed line is ok.  That just means you are following children or parents.  That continues the blood line.

\end{notation}





\begin{notation}

The Samir - Hannah - Angela path is an example of a path containing half a dashed line. Samir - Hannah is a solid path and then half of the Hannah-Robert dashed path is travelled to continue to Angela.  This path preserves the "related by blood" connection.

The Samir-Hannah-Robert path includes the full dashed line segment connecting Hannah and Robert.  Crossing over from Hannah to Robert would break the ?related by blood? connection.

If we were examining relatives and were including marriages then crossing a full dashed line segment might retain that relation. Perhaps new rules would present themselves. Perhaps "related by marriage" could only include one dashed line segment.  The mathematics of each type of relation would carry their own rules mirroring the structure discovered via our science.

Currently, we are investigating the "related by blood" relation. We are referring to this just as "related".
