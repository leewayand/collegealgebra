    \choice[correct]{no}
  \end{multipleChoice}
  \begin{feedback}
    $V$ is not a polynomial. The domain of a polynomial is
    $(-\infty,\infty)$. $V$ is a polynomial on a restricted domain.

\begin{exercise}
  As $x$ increases from $1$ to $(1+h)$, the total surface area of the
  box changes by
  \[
  S(1+h) - S(1) = \answer{-8}h^2 + \answer{-16}h
  \]
  So as $x$ increases by $h$, the surface areas decreases by
  $\answer{16h+8h^2}$.

  As a final exercise, illustrate this change in a picture and share your picture with a classmate.
