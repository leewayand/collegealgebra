  Use the map to define a new relation.
  \begin{definition}
  The \dfn{sibling} relation includes three sets:
    \begin{itemize}
    \item A first set consisting of all family members.
    \item A second set consisting of all family members.
    \item A set of family ordered pairs. The pair (first person, second person) is a member of the Sibling relation if the first person and the second person have the same mother and father.
    \end{itemize}
  
  \end{definition}

\begin{exercise}
Are both ({\includegraphics[width=50px,height=65px]{pics/people/lily.png}}, {\includegraphics[width=50px,height=65px]{pics/people/marissa.png}}) and 
({\includegraphics[width=50px,height=65px]{pics/people/marissa.png}}, {\includegraphics[width=50px,height=65px]{pics/people/lily.png}})
in the Sibling relation?

  \begin{multipleChoice}

\begin{exercise}
If (person1, person2) is in the Sibling relation, then is (person2, person1) always in Sibling?

  \begin{multipleChoice}
    \choice[correct]{Yes}
    \choice{No}
  \end{multipleChoice}
  \begin{feedback}
Both person1 and person2 are in the first and second set, since both sets consists of all family members. If (person1, person2) is in Sibling, then person1 and person2 have the same mother and father. That is the criteria for (person2, person1) to be in Sibling.
  \end{feedback}
\end{exercise}




\begin{exercise}
Is Sibling symmetric?

  \begin{multipleChoice}
    \choice[correct]{Yes}
    \choice{No}
  \end{multipleChoice}
  \begin{feedback}
If (person1, person2) is in Sibling, then (person2, person1) is in Sibling.
  \end{feedback}
\end{exercise}





\begin{exercise}
Is Sibling transitive?

  \begin{multipleChoice}
    \choice[correct]{Yes}
    \choice{No}
  \end{multipleChoice}
  \begin{feedback}
If (person1, person2) is in Sibling and (person2, person3) is in Sibling, then person1, person2, and person3 all have the same mother and father. Therefore, (person1, person3) is in Sibling.
  \end{feedback}
\end{exercise}




\begin{exercise}
Is Sibling reflexive?

  \begin{multipleChoice}
    \choice[correct]{Yes}
    \choice{No}
  \end{multipleChoice}
  \begin{feedback}
  person1 has the same mother and father as person1.  That is all that is required.  Therefore, (person1, person1) is in Sibling. Sibling is reflexive.
  \end{feedback}
\end{exercise}
