  Use the map to define a new relation.
  \begin{definition}
  The \dfn{sibling} relation includes three sets:
    \begin{itemize}
    \item A first set consisting of all family members.
    \item A second set consisting of all family members.
    \item A set of family ordered pairs. The pair (first person, second person) is a member of the Sibling relation if the first person and the second person have the same mother and father.
    \end{itemize}
